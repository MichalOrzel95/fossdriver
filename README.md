# fossdriver

fossdriver is intended to enable scriptable control of a [FOSSology server](https://www.fossology.org). (fossdriver doesn't contain a FOSSology server; you'll have to go get and set one up yourself.)

This package is significantly based on, and inspired by, the excellent [fossup](https://gitlab.com/toganlabs/fossup) FOSSology Uploader package from Tog√°n Labs.
